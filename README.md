## Mission objectives (if this is a Consolidation Challenge)

* Be able to create a prediction model
* Be able to deploy your model
* Be able to work in a team
* Be able to build an api.

## The Mission
You need to create an API that will make price forecasts on houses according to certain parameters (Zip code, number of rooms, surface area, etc...). This API will be used by webdevs who will be able to use it to create an interface for the ImmoEliza agency.


### Must-have features
- The api must be functional 
- Your model must be functional

### Nice-to-have features

- Your API searches for as much information as possible on its own. (For example, area => cadastre)
- You provide a 3d representation of the house 
- You provide a representation of the 3d coordinates of the house

### Steps
1. Create the repository - Adam   
2. Create Trello to track progress - Valentin
3. Study the request (What & Why ?)
4. Identify technical challenges (How ?)
5. Create and save your model - Adam
6. Create your API 
7. Integrate your model into your API
