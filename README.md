## Mission objectives  

- [X] Be able to create a prediction model
- [X] Be able to deploy your model
- [X] Be able to work in a team
- [X] Be able to build an api.

## The Mission

You need to create an API that will make price forecasts on houses according to certain parameters (Zip code, number of rooms, surface area, etc...). This API will be used by webdevs who will be able to use it to create an interface for the ImmoEliza agency.


### Must-have features

- [X] The api must be functional 
- [X] Your model must be functional

### Additional features

- [X] to provide house/apartment average price (square per meter) for all cities in Belgium
- [X] to show the difference (%) between house/apartment sq/m2 versus the average sq/m2 for the city
